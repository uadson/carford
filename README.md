[![Build](https://github.com/uadson/carford/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/uadson/carford/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Nork-Town is a weird place.  
Crows cawk the misty morning while old men squint.  
It’s a smalltown, so the mayor had a bright idea to limit the number of cars a person may possess.  
One person may have up to 3 vehicles.  
The vehicle, registered to a person, may have one color,‘yellow’, ‘blue’ or ‘gray’.  
And one of three models, ‘hatch’, ‘sedan’ or ‘convertible’.  
Carford car shop want a system where they can add car owners and cars.  
Car owners may not have cars yet, they need to be marked as a sale opportunity.  
Cars cannot exist in the system without owners.
